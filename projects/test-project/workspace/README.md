I will create a Snake game in Python using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The game will have keyboard controls for user input. The project will be structured as follows:

1. main.py: The entry point of the application.
2. model.py: Contains the game's data model classes.
3. view.py: Contains the game's view classes for rendering.
4. controller.py: Contains the game's controller classes for handling user input.
5. requirements.txt: Lists the required packages for the project.

Now, I will provide the content of each file.

main.py
